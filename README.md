# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Course Overview

This course provides a **practical introduction to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)**, allowing you to customize models with your own data for improved performance. Unlike prompt engineering or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning updates the modelâ€™s neural network weights, enabling it to **learn new knowledge, adapt to specific styles, and enhance accuracy**.

### What You'll Learn
- **Fundamentals of LLM fine-tuning** and how it differs from other techniques.
- **When to apply fine-tuning** versus prompt engineering.
- **How to prepare datasets** and train an LLM for real-world applications.
- **Evaluating fine-tuned models** to measure improvements effectively.
- **Deploying fine-tuned models** using services like Lamini.

Taught by **Sharon Zhou**, Co-Founder and CEO of Lamini, this course blends **theory with hands-on practice**, equipping you with the skills to fine-tune LLMs for your own projects.
